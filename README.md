This module is ment to replace the original USB 2.0 mini port on the Ducky Shine3, making it compatible with any USB C data cable.

The project includes KiCad files. Feel free to edit and modify to your own needs. This also includes the gerber files if you want to order this PCB without doing any modifications. I've had one successful order of this PCB from JLCPCB without any issues.

To install this module you will have to slightly enlarge the USB connector opening in the hard plastic shell of the keyboard. I did this using my soldering iron and then tidied it up with a small file.
